        **Deferred resource registration**

        Resources can optionally be registered in a deferred manner.  Simply pass
        `defer=True` to :meth:`.ArrestedAPI.register_resource` to attach the resource to
        the API without calling register_blueprint.

        This is useful when you're using the factory pattern for creating your Flask app
        object as demonstrated below. Deferred resource will not be registered until the
        ArrestedAPI instance is initialised with the Flask app object.
