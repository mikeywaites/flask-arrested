#flask-arrested
==============

A python REST API framework for flask

####What does flask-arrested offer me?

* Generic ApiResources (*views*) convering all HTTP methods as well as a function based api for the die hard flask fans.

* Well tested, robust API thats used heavily in production already.

* Best practice patterns for saving, retrieveing and manipulating data via a flexible hooks system

####What are the goals of flask-arrested?

* Provide a flexible well documented framework for rapidly building rest api endpoints in a re-usable and robust way.

* Don't make assumptions about the right or wrong way to write a rest api, simply provide a beautiful set of tools for getting things done with HTTP and flask

* Dont reinvent the wheel.  Flask already handles HTTP amazingly - Simply provide the tools and components to make common patterns in rest easier and quicker to implement.

* Give users confidence.  A framework whos offering is about speed and ease of use shouldn't shy form robustness and predictability.  Offer a full suite of easily runnable tests covering the full code base.

* Extensible.  Whilst not making assumptions about how users should implement auth or serilization etc,  Still provide a lib of options that define best practice or 'go to tools' for getting things done.
